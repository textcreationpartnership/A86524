         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>I would not have you ignorant, that all our fathers were under the Cloud, and all pa≈ø≈øed through the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> I wil ≈øhew you the ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle; His aim is to pull a way the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence which they placed in their priviledges, which they thought would pre≈øerve them from plagues: They could ≈øay, we have Bapti≈øme and the Supper of the Lord, we eate the fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, and drink his blood, and are advanced, ≈øo that we ≈øhall be pre≈øerved from ≈øuch plagues. No (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) the≈øe will not doe it; for I can ≈øhew you a people had the≈øe as well as you, which were overthrowne and de≈øtroyed in the wilderne≈ø≈øe; they were as eminent as you, and yet they were de≈øtroyed, they had the Cloud and the Sea, as well as you have Bapti≈øme; and they had Manna, and the water out of the Rock, as well as you have bread and wine in the Supper of the Lord; yet their priviledges would not pre≈øerve them; no more will yours pre≈øerve you. This is the meaning of God in the words; ≈øo as it is a folly for us to think, if we ≈øin as they did, that we ≈øhould not be plagued as they were. They that are truly ≈øaid to be truly baptized in the right u≈øe of their Sacraments, their Sacraments are the like with ours: but ≈øo they are ≈øaid to be by the Spirit of God: <hi>Thry were baptized,</hi> are the words of the Text, and therefore if we ≈øhould deny it, we deny the words of the Spirit of God, which is bla≈øphemy to doe. The rea≈øon lies in the phra≈øe: not becau≈øe the ≈øignes are the ≈øame, though the ≈øame thing be ≈øignified: in≈øtead of Bapti≈øme is the Cloud and Sea; the red Sea held forth the like good to them, as ours to us, the force is the ≈øame; there is the like vertue in the one, as in the other: They are the fle≈øh of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and drank the blood of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> as we do: The Manna, and the Water out of the Rock, was the ≈øame with our Supper of the Lord; for the good of the Suuper is <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> he is there, and our ≈øpirits fea≈øt; <hi>His fle≈øh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed;</hi> the whole does ≈øignifie and exhibit CHRIST it is like ours, the elements are not the ≈øame, but there is the ≈øame ≈øpirituall food, and they ≈øeale up the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111041:7"/>≈øame <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> to them as to us, <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is pre≈øented as ≈øpirituall refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them and us. It is a dream of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> they were not the ≈øame with ours; for though theirs were extraordinary: yet that hinders not the Argument; we look at it as a Sacrament, not at the extraordinarine≈ø≈øe of it.</p>
            <p>The third Argument: That ≈øen≈øe that overthrowes the ≈øen≈øe of the Apo≈øtle, that is to be rejected: But to ≈øay that I≈ørael did not enjoy the ≈øame priviledges in the kind of them, is to make the ≈øen≈øe of the Apo≈øtle void, and therefore it is to be rejected: The Jewes provoking God, ≈øhall be puni≈øhed, ≈øo ≈øhall you. It had been ea≈øie to have an≈øwered, they are not of that excellency that ours be; and therefore though theirs could not pre≈øerve them, ours may. But now if yee attend the mind of God, it is cleare, theirs are the ≈øame with outs in the kinde of them. And this is the fir≈øt thing that may prevent all cavils.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is from that, <hi>Rom</hi> 4 11. <hi>Abraham received the ≈øigne of Circumci≈øion, as the ≈øeale of the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of faith, &amp;c.</hi> that is, the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> received by faith, ≈øealed by circumci≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that was the ≈øeale of the righteou≈øne≈øle of faith by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øo as they have ≈øpirituall efficacy with bapti≈øme, they have the utmo≈øt power a Sacrament hath, to ≈øignifie, ≈øeale, and exhibite the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good of the covenant of Grace: it is a ≈øeale God appointed and it doth exhibit. When a man hath ≈øet to his Seale, he ≈øtands ingaged this promi≈øe he doe accompli≈øh. Every promi≈øe a man makes, if he perform it not, it is becau≈øe he is feeble and cannot, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he is unfaithfull and will not, but the≈øe cannot befall God: ≈øo there is exhibition where there is ≈øealing, if it be appointed for the ≈øame; and bapti≈øme can doe no more but ≈øignifie, ≈øeale, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: ≈øo is circumci≈øion a covenant of Faith, ≈øo there is no gain≈øaying, but the Argument is plain in the Text. I will make ≈øome collections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence it is plain, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, was the covenant of the Go≈øpel and Grace: It is proved thus, That which was the Covenant of the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øs of faith, is the covenant of the Go≈øpel; that this is ≈øo, we may ≈øee it by the Apo≈øtle, <hi>If it be of workes, it is not of faith; if it be of faith, it is not of workes,</hi> Rom. 3, But <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant is a covenant of the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of faith: That which circumci≈øion ≈øealed, was a covenant to <hi>Abraham;</hi> to ≈øay it was a carnall covenant, is gro≈ø≈øe; and to ≈øay it was not a covenant of Faith, is to deny the text, and dig it up by the roots. So we ≈øee that it was a covenant of grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sacraments in the old Te≈øtament require and pre≈øume, and pre≈øuppo≈øe in the right u≈øe of them, <hi>Faith in the receiver,</hi> as being the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111041:7"/>righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of God, I know not how any can deny it, it is ≈øo clear theirs did require faith as well as ours doe. The efficacie of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rightly u≈øed, is to ≈øeale up our ≈øalvation; but abu≈øed, it ≈øealts up our condemnation. The right u≈øe of it is to e≈øtabli≈øh our hearts, but the abu≈øe of it doth ha≈øten our condemnation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some per≈øons my rightly u≈øe a Sacrament with allowance from God, and may receive the good thereof, that have not the exerci≈øe of rea≈øon, as <hi>Infants,</hi> as we may ≈øee in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time: And this will give an an≈øwer to all them that ≈øhall ≈øay, How can infants get good by Bapti≈øme, when they have not the u≈øe of rea≈øon? <hi>Abrahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had the good of the Sacrament ≈øealed up unto them, and yet they had not the u≈øe of rea≈øon; yet they had a right unto it by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 According to a right rule from God, and right Rea≈øon, per≈øons may have faith in the cour≈øe of charity, that have not the u≈øe of rea≈øon: they in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time had grace, and that was the grace of Faith; if it ≈øeale up, ≈øome may have it; but that ≈øome children are thus fitted, and faith is ≈øealed unto them in circumci≈øion, if any will deny it, they mu≈øt deny the Text, and that is impudency it ≈øelfe. If ≈øo, why not in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme as well as Circumci≈øion; for Circumci≈øion mu≈øt have faith, ≈øo mu≈øt they in Bapti≈øme?</p>
            <p n="5">5 There is more required of ≈øome per≈øons then there is of other in receving of the ≈øame ≈øacrament in the alowance of God, &amp; according to right Rea≈øon; there is more required of men, then there is of children: Take a man that is to joyn in the covenant of the people, he is bound to ≈øtoop to the Ordinance, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 56.67. The ≈øtrangers that were to joyne, they mu≈øt keep the Sabbath, and embrace the Covenant, &amp;c. This is to make a pro≈øelyte, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. they are made of the ≈øame profe≈ø≈øion. Men of yeares mu≈øt approve of the things of God, and walk accordingly; all this is required of men of yeares, and then to offer them≈øelves to the ordinances, for they did never force them: but in children this is not required, if the Father had embraced the Faith. So as you may ≈øee the≈øe things are plain, wkich if they be ob≈øerved, it will make you ca≈øt away Anabapti≈øme.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture is in <hi>Colo≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.11, 12. if the effects of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the old Te≈øtament and the new, be the ≈øame, then they are the ≈øame: the effect done by the thing, ≈øhewes the thing: if the things wrought be the ≈øame, then it is alike; but the things done are the ≈øame. The Apo≈øtle in the Text ≈øhewes it is the ≈øame in Circumci≈øion, as in Bapti≈øme, both ≈øeale up the death of Chri≈øt; there was decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111041:8"/>both were for the ma≈øtering, or le≈ø≈øening and decaying of ≈øin, ≈øo doth circumci≈øion by cutting off the fore-skin in the ≈øame operation.</p>
            <p>Now there are two objections to be an≈øwered from ≈øeverall Texts, it appeares they are the ≈øame with ours. The fir≈øt is that in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Circumci≈øion is nothing, nor uncircumci≈øion, but the keeping of the command of God.</hi> The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking to per≈øons to keep in the ≈øame Calling God had called them, he ≈øaith, <hi>Circumci≈øion is nothing, &amp;c.</hi> The next is <hi>Galat,</hi> 6.13. they make nothing of it. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Chri≈øt Circumci≈øion nor uncircumci≈øion availeth any thing, but faith that worketh by love:</hi> that is, ≈øay they, it is weake, and can doe nothing, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Chri≈øt ≈øhall profit them nothing if they be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed;</hi> and the Apo≈øtle ≈øayes, <hi>Beware of Circumci≈øion,</hi> by way of Irony, ≈øo as he accounts it as nothing. All the≈øe places are of the ≈øame nature, and may receive the ≈øame an≈øwer to them all. God lookes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the≈øe Sacraments to be attended according to a double time and con≈øideration. Fir≈øt, in the fir≈øt in≈øtitution they had an eye to, and did ≈øeale up Chri≈øt to come in the fle≈øh, when they were fir≈øt ordained by God, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. God lookes at them as having attained their end and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which was Chri≈øt to come: therefore when he was come, they had an end. Therefore now they were of no u≈øe, being out of date; and now they could not be u≈øed without ≈øinne: he appoints now therefore to abrogate them, they were to cea≈øe becau≈øe Chri≈øt was come: though they were alike at the fir≈øt, now they were out of date, now they were not to be u≈øed. To this purpo≈øe are all the≈øe places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.19. <hi>If thou be called being uncircumci≈øed, be not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed:</hi> if you were circumci≈øed when it was in date, then ≈øeek not to be uncircumci≈øed: if you be uncircumci≈øed, be not circumci≈øed now it is out of date. It cannot be taken the Apo≈øtle for bad circumci≈øion when it was in date; for then he had ≈øpoken again≈øt the command of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. He commanded them to be circumci≈øed. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>For in Chri≈øt Je≈øus neither circumci≈øion, &amp;c. availeth any thing, but a new creature.</hi> For though they were given to the Jewes, yet now they were gone out of the world, and ≈øo now they availed not. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, to ≈øet them up now, was to ≈øet up that which God had de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that now nothing availed, but faith and a new creature. And <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.4. <hi>He is fallen from Grace;</hi> but now he doth not attend the fir≈øt in≈øtitution, if he doe, hee nullifies the nature of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe when Chri≈øt is come, it is to deny Chri≈øt to be come in the fle≈øh. This is a heynous thing, Chri≈øt ≈øhall doe him no good, Chri≈øt will not ≈øave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111041:8"/>him. In the la≈øt place, he ≈øpeakes this to fal≈øe Apo≈øtles, that would have men partly ≈øaved by Chri≈øt, and partly by workes; and ≈øo they nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chri≈øt, and the work of grace: for he mu≈øt have all or none, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not joyne works and grace together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 2. From the witne≈ø≈øe of the word, <hi>Colo≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Which were but a ≈øhadow of things to come, but the body is Chri≈øt.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18 they are ≈øaid to be weak. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 13. called <hi>a carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> And if it be ≈øo, then they are not alike with ours in the new Te≈øtament, they are of another nature, the ≈øpirituall work of the ≈øoule. For an≈øwer, the Sacraments are apprehended in a double ≈øen≈øe, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or as ≈øeparate from the thing ≈øignified; but the Apo≈øtle lookes at them as carnall now, as <hi>Heb</hi> 7.18, 19. he ≈øaith, <hi>The Law was weake, and made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Chri≈øt he accompl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>≈øheth all, and brings in a better hope of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ≈øinnes. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21, 22. it is not the water, but the thing ≈øignified by the water. So the ≈øigne is weak, but the thing ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is ≈øtrong. So the ca≈øe is cleare.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Conclu≈øion.</hi> The ≈øpirituall efficacy of the Sacraments in the old and new Te≈øtament, proceed not from them≈øelves immediatly u≈øed in the working of any good, but as they are u≈øed by the holy Gho≈øt. The con≈øideration whereof will help in the main point, to ≈øhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the working of the Sacrament, for it is a great ≈øecret, and the want of the knowledge hereof, is the cau≈øe per≈øons get ≈øo little good by the Sacrament. This propo≈øition hath two parts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, the ≈øpirituall influence the Sacraments put forth, is not from them≈øelves immediatly, but as they are u≈øed by the Spirit. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under≈øtanding of this fir≈øt part, con≈øider it in ≈øome things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Sacrament is not a principall, but an in≈øtrumental cau≈øe in any ≈øpirituall work: they doe not ≈øet them≈øelves a work, but they worke under the principall agent; as a toole in the hand of a man, ≈øo in the work of the Sacrament, it is by the mediation of the Spirit, and the meanes of faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16. <hi>Hee that beleeves and is baptized, &amp;c. But he that believeth not, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>That he might ≈øanctifie it and clean≈øe it by water through the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sacraments as in≈øtruments, put forth a ≈øpirituall efficacie, when they are lawfully u≈øed according to God: but not when they are abu≈øed in an unlawfull manner, and unworthily received; then they doe not put forth any ≈øpirituall efficacie. Thus the Supper of the Lord puts forth ≈øpirituall efficacie when it is ordered in a lawfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>Is is not the communion of the body of Chri≈øt?</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:111041:9"/>And the <hi>Cup of ble≈ø≈øing</hi> is the ≈øame, and yet <hi>be that receives is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He that abu≈øes the Kings ≈øeale is puni≈øhed, and therefore much more the≈øe. The Go≈øpel is the power of God to ≈øalvation, but it mu≈øt bee mixed with faith, and then it is the ≈øavour of life unto life, but without it, is the ≈øavour of death unto death. And ≈øo is the Sacrament; therfore when a thing is lawfully done, it is no ≈øinne, but if it be abu≈øed, then it is ≈øinfull: therefore that the Sacrament is abu≈øed, it is from ≈øinne; but the ≈øpirituall work of a Sacrament helps forward to ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The ≈øpirituall efficacy a Sacrament puts forth, is not as a Phy≈øicall in≈øtrument, but as a Morall. I put it in the≈øe termes, that I might cleare it up in their termes which they u≈øe which darken the truth. Now ≈øee the explication, In≈øtruments are of a double nature, ≈øome have quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inherent, that is, ≈øticking in them by nature; as ≈øome phy≈øicall hearbs are of a purging nature, others comfortable, they have it in their nature put into them ≈øo to work, and it abides in them, but other are made ≈øerviceable by Art, they are made ≈øharp or ≈øweet: Or in tooles, ≈øome are made ≈øharp, fit for u≈øe, as a bone wil not cut our bread, but we mu≈øt have ≈øomething made ≈øharp: ≈øo things are made phy≈øicall either by Nature or by Art. The Papi≈øts call it Phy≈øicall in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they ≈øay the Sacraments work naturally, if taken, they have a quality to convey grace: the Sacrament taken, they ≈øay, will worke of it ≈øelfe; but it is a gro≈ø≈øe conceit to ≈øatisfie a carnall heart: then a drunken wretch mu≈øt have grace, if he can but have the u≈øe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Thus the Papi≈øts derogate from Chri≈øt, by making a quality to be inherent in the Sacraments, to convey grace into any man that receives them.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> di≈øtinction is, they are morally good, as ≈øome in≈øtruments that have no power of them≈øelves, but as they are ≈øtated by way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as he that u≈øes them doth appoint them: As a piece of wax is appointed to ≈øeale up a bargain, the Wax conveys nothing, it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a witne≈ø≈øe to ≈øet forth the truth as the party is ingaged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to agreement: as <hi>Elijahs</hi> Cloke divided the waters, it was not in the Cloke, but it was a ≈øigne to intimate that God would be with him. So the Bra≈øen Serpent was appointed of God for the people that were ≈øtung, by looking on it they ≈øhould be healed: there was no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the bra≈ø≈øe to heale them: for afterwards in <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111041:9"/>was no inherent vertue in the bra≈ø≈øe, but God appointed it for this end as a morall in≈øtrument.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When the Sacraments are thus taken for ≈øuch an end, and to ≈øuch a work, there is a divine vertue goes along with them for that end, the ≈øame power that did appoint them, will goe along with them, and will work in them for that end. There be three things in the in≈øtitution of them.</p>

            <p>Fir≈øt, That there is a portion and provi≈øion of Grace appointed by God, and be≈øtowed of God on ≈øome children, according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell of his own will. Here are two things to be avoided.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Curio≈øity: for ≈øecret things belong to God.</item>
               <item>2 Carele≈øne≈ø≈øe: for where God hath a mouth to ≈øpeak, we mu≈øt have an eare to heate.</item>
            </list>
            <p>We mu≈øt be carefull therefore to know this truth: But what the number of Infants be, and after what manner he doth be≈øtow this Grace, I will ≈øay nothing; but what the Word hath learned me, I will learn you, That ≈øome children are elected, and God will ≈øanctifie them, and glorifie them; but for the number, and manner, I leave that. Mr <hi>Spilsbery</hi> oppo≈øes two of the≈øe, <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Glorification,</hi> when they are again≈øt the expre≈ø≈øions of the Word; ≈øo they are not onely er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but gro≈ø≈øe errors. In the third page, line 14. his words are, <hi>They mu≈øt be capable of Grace, or el≈øe they are not elected.</hi> Now he ≈øaith, children in their nonage are not ≈øubjects of <hi>Election,</hi> or of <hi>Glory.</hi> I oppo≈øe both; There is a portion of Grace for children, and Glory: If he ≈øpeak to the purpo≈øe, and ≈øay, there is no faith in Election; or capability of Glory; I doe not think children becau≈øe they are children, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected &amp; glorified, there is no ≈øhew of the que≈øtion in that ancient men are not elected becau≈øe they are old, nor glorified becau≈øe they are old; he will ≈øave them from ≈øinne, not as they are old, or rich, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, that is not ≈øen≈øible: &amp; therefore his meaning is, that Children fall not within compa≈ø≈øe of election, nor if they dye, to have glory; and that is a gro≈ø≈øe error. There is a number of children that it is the purpo≈øe of God according to election to ≈øave them. <hi>Rom</hi> 9.11, 12. <hi>The children being not yet born, it was ≈øaid, The elder ≈øhall ≈øerve the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Was not E≈øau Jacobs brother? yet I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Jacob, and hated E≈øau.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Whom he will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> And this is upon children not as children, but while they are ≈øuch; all the men in the world are either ve≈ø≈øels of mercy, or ve≈ø≈øels of wrath, according to the good will of God.</p>
            <p>Now if all be under election or reprobation, to ≈øay all children are rejected, were gro≈ø≈øe, <hi>Gene≈ø.</hi> 25.22, 23. <hi>The children ≈øtruggle in her womb, the Lord ≈øaid, Two Nations are in thy womb, &amp;c.</hi> And they were types of the children of light, and the children of darkne≈ø≈øe, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111041:14"/>≈øo mu≈øt our children be children of light, or children of darkne≈ø≈øe. Now to ≈øay all are rejected, he hath not the face of a man that will ≈øay ≈øo; for the Word hath taught us the contrary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if there be a number of children to whom the Kingdome of Heaven belongs unto, then ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe belongs to children: But that it is ≈øo, appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>For of ≈øuch is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Now Anabapti≈øts darken that place, and ≈øay, The≈øe are not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but men of years, ≈øuch as are humble, &amp; of a childlike di≈øpo≈øition. But the Glo≈ø≈øe does corrupt the Text, and cro≈ø≈øes the ≈øcope of the place: for Chri≈øt ≈øpake it to make it appeare they may bee ble≈ø≈øed here, thus: If to ≈øuch belong the Kingdome of Heaven, they may bee glorified; if they may be glorified, then they may be ble≈ø≈øed here. The ≈øen≈øe the Anabapti≈øts give, makes it ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe: if it ≈øtand thus, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven belongs to the humble, it is one thing to be humble. and another thing to be ble≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>What is this to children of yeares? If children belong to heaven, they may be ble≈ø≈øed here, and therefore our Saviour calls them, and bids them come to him, that he might ble≈ø≈øe them: and the nature of the thing teacheth it; for there are but two places after this life, Hell or Heaven, except men will follow the dotage of the Papi≈øts, to make a Purgatory, which fire was kindled in the Popes Kitchin. Now to ≈øay all children that are dead are in hell, they dare not ≈øay ≈øo: now that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spilsbery</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>He will ≈øay nothing to it:</hi> he mu≈øt ≈øay ≈øo; for he can ≈øay nothing to any purpo≈øe, therefore he ≈øpeakes that to dazle mens eyes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are ≈øome children God will work grace in now, <hi>Luke</hi> 1 15. it is ≈øaid of <hi>John, That hee was filled with the holy Gho≈øt from his mothers womb.</hi> Chri≈øt did ≈øanctifie one, to ≈øhew there are more that ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> and ≈øhall be ≈øanctified here, and therefore it appeares there are a number of children that God doth be≈øtow grace upon here, and ≈øhall be glorified hereafter.</p>
            <p>And although the manner of Gods working upon children be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> mans account, yet it is ordinary with God to work it in them, that day he workes faith in them, certainly they are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the work of the Spirit, as men are; but the manner of working is ≈øecret. But it is Gods common cour≈øe; and certainly he doth work faith in them. Infants are as capable as men con≈øidering the work of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Propo≈øition: Although the manner of working be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in re≈øpect of the meanes, and the per≈øons upon whom it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111041:15"/>is wrought, yet in regard of God it is ordinary and ea≈øie; and he doth certainly work faith in the hearts of infants that die in their infancy, that are elected; and al≈øo in regard of the Spirit that is the worker of it in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is extraordinary in regard of the meanes; if we have an eye to, the meanes, that puts not forth that power as it doth when there is a concurrence of all things that are ≈øutable to work with the means; and therefore when this is wanting now to do it, is extraordinary; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants doe not, nor cannot thus concurre: for they cannot exerci≈øe their under≈øtanding, they cannot put it forth as men of yeares can doe, they cannot put forth to the ≈øignification, they cannot take it in ≈øo far as to affect their hearts with the nature of it: therfore all ≈øuch power upon their actual apprehen≈øions, ≈øignification, taking, &amp; working, of abilities of their own, it is onely to men of yeares, it is beyond the rank and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of infants, and the means cannot worke in this regard beyond their order and rank, to doe as to men of yeares they may. And the ≈øame may be ≈øaid of circumci≈øion; for there is the like difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men of yeares and infants in that, and yet this did not hinder Gods end in that ordinance, nor did it prejudice the good God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be≈øtow upon infants, though the abilities of infants could not receive it from the Ordinance, or the Ordinance receive help from them: for this is extraordinary, and beyond the parts of a child, that is the meaning of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Yet in regard of God it is his ordinary cour≈øe, and certainly he doth work faith in the hearts of all elected infants that dye in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Doe not ≈øtumble that I u≈øe the phra≈øes of <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> in regard of the parties and meanes, it is ordinary with God, for we may ≈øee it ≈øo in other workes of God, as in the work of vocation there is an infu≈øion of a ≈øpirituall principle into the ≈øoule, which is beyond all the abilities of the nature of any man to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own ≈øoule: but if we look at the work of God, then the way that God hath made known, is ordinary, and a continued cour≈øe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe a principle of grace into the ≈øoule. So it is Gods ordinary way to put faith into an infant that is elected, and dies an infant. As for in≈øtance, there are many revelations of God, every revelation is a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Spirit, but it is according to the Word. Now although it is extraordinary in regard of the work of the Spirit revealing; yet it is ordinary with God. Now this comes to the heart of the cau≈øe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this give me leave to do three things.</p>

            <p n="1">1 In the meaning of it, the ≈øecre≈øie of God does drive men to much trouble: it is like an unbeaten way to the Seamen, they mu≈øt ≈øound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of it.</p>

               <item>5 Some think God does powre faith into the heart of infants that die in infancie that be elected, that they ≈øhall be converted, and put into Chri≈øt: this is the main truth of the que≈øtion. God does powre it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ≈øoule, and ≈øo the ≈øoule is converted, and planted into Chri≈øt as the head of the covenant. This is the ≈øtate of the controver≈øie, and this I ≈øhall labour to ≈øtrengthen.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, it ≈øhould not be ≈øtrange, nor need not to bee counted hard to any judicious Chri≈øtian, to a≈ø≈øent to this. The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe there is a work alike, in a parity to that which is daily expre≈ø≈øed in the cour≈øe of Gods providence, and is acknowledged by all judicious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt. And if it be ≈øo, why may he not doe the like in this? That there is a like work, and that it is acknowledged, appeares thus: It is a confe≈ø≈øed truth that the Lord does infu≈øe a ≈øoule into the body, and the ≈øoule is pure and holy as it comes from him, otherwi≈øe God mu≈øt be the authour of ≈øinne; yet through the ≈øinne and guilt of <hi>Adam,</hi> the ≈øoule is turned from God, and is po≈ø≈øe≈øt with originall ≈øinne, and ≈øo ≈øin and guilt is imputed, and the cur≈øe ju≈øtly inflicted. And the ≈øoule being thus wholly turned from God, it is wholly po≈ø≈øe≈øt with originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It is a delu≈øion to ≈øay the ≈øoule is propagated. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam beg at a ≈øonne in his own image,</hi> being wholly turned from God, and turned to ≈øin. And <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fla≈øh is fle≈øh;</hi> all comes from the ≈øin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now mark, if this be ≈øo, that the ≈øin &amp; guilt of <hi>Adam</hi> is thus conveyed, and the guilt &amp; cur≈øe, this is done dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though we ≈øee not the manner how it is done: then why may not Chri≈øt convey grace, turne the heart of a child from ≈øin to him≈øelf? the party is the ≈øame as before, and look to the cau≈øe, and it is greater in the latter then in the former: if we looke at Chri≈øt, there is an advantage in rea≈øon to believe the latter rather then the former; and why ≈øhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111041:16"/>it be thought a thing incredible, ≈øeeing the fir≈øt <hi>Adam</hi> can turn away the ≈øoule from God, but that Chri≈øt by the power of his merits, may convert Infants to him≈øelfe; and why then ≈øhould it bee incredible? Now one of the≈øe are done from day to day, and none doubt of it, I meane the fir≈øt; and the ≈øecond we have more advantage to believe, becau≈øe the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> is above the fir≈øt, and why then ≈øhould not the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> be as readily a≈ø≈øented unto as the fir≈øt; but every man is forced to yeeld the fir≈øt (that is judicious) let us not doubt the ≈øecond.</p>
            <p>One thing is to be noted in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spilsbery's</hi> Booke, in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page, 19 lines from the end, where he ≈øaith, <hi>The word condemnes none but for actuall ≈øinne;</hi> if he mean, as he mu≈øt needs doe, no man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned but for the ≈øinne of the party it ≈øelfe, it is a gro≈ø≈øe error, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>For as by one man ≈øinne entredinto the world, and death by ≈øinne, &amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ver≈øe, <hi>If by the finne of one man judgement came upon all,</hi> then for the ≈øinne of <hi>Adam</hi> God may ju≈øtly condemne all, though they never commit actuall ≈øin, is the judgement of all that are judicious. Death over ≈øpread all by <hi>Adams</hi> ≈øinne, and therefore wee ≈øee in infants that dye, <hi>Adams</hi> ≈øin was actuall; and let him ≈øhift what he can, the ca≈øe is cleare, and the word condemnes men for originall ≈øinne: <hi>The wages of ≈øinne is death;</hi> ≈øo originall ≈øinne it is the rebelling again≈øt the law of out mind, and therefore it mu≈øt be ≈øinne, and to ≈øay the contrary, is a gro≈ø≈øe ful≈øome error: Mark when ≈øuch errors come from the pens of men, it ≈øhewes there is more behind; and he mu≈øt ≈øay, either originall ≈øin is no ≈øin, or that infants have no originall ≈øinne: And if he ≈øay ≈øo then the ≈øin of the heathen cannot hinder, but that all their children that dye, mu≈øt be ≈øaved. If you look in the forenamed place in his book, you may finde it: I ≈øpeak it that men that have the books may find it. And let no man think that the≈øe things be ≈øtrange, ≈øeeing the like is done, that you may ≈øee with ea≈øe.</p>

            <p>Now to the third thing: the third branch is, that in regard of the operation of the ≈øpirit, Infants are as capable as men, I am forced to ≈øpeak thus, becau≈øe I mu≈øt have to deale with Mr. <hi>Spilebery,</hi> and that I might meet with him, I have on purpo≈øe expre≈ø≈øed my ≈øelf on this manner: When it is objected to him, that Infants are capable, he an≈øwers in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> page, and the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> line, thus, <hi>If by being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable be meant oppo≈øition again≈øt the Spirit, that they cannot oppo≈øe the ≈øpirit in working on them, then ≈øtones are capable; for God can rai≈øe of ≈øtones Children to</hi> Abraham: <hi>but if this be the meaning, they are as able to comply with the Spirit, I deny it: and to affirm that, this is the way God u≈øes to bring children to him, I oppo≈øe it; and it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues ignorance to ≈øay ≈øo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I an≈øwer, it is the truth of God, and it is Gods way to work ≈øo, and that Children are as capable as men of years; if we eye the operation of the Spirit, and the di≈øpen≈øation thereof, they are as capable as men, much more therefore then ≈øtones; and that I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and prove in foure things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The nature of man as it was made fit for grace before the fall, ≈øo it is capable of grace after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> when I ≈øay capable, I ≈øay two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øoule and body need not be changed from their being, when they receive grace, the nature of the ≈øoule and body being not changed, but unfitted for any ≈øpirituall work: As take a Clock that all the wheels are out of frame, you need not make new Wheels but onely rectifie them, if they be foule make them clean, if they be wrong right them; ≈øo by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> all, ≈øoule and body is out of frame, and out of joynt, the minde unfit to know God, and the will unfit to clo≈øe with God; before the fall all were in frame, but when it jarred again≈øt the Law, then Originall ≈øinne came upon all his ≈øeed, and that makes them jarre again≈øt the law: now when a ≈øinner comes to be renewed, there needes not new faculties, but tho≈øe he hath, to be ≈øet in frame; this is the meaning of the Spirit of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Plow up your fallow ground, &amp;c.</hi> ≈øo the minde is arrable ground although it be over grown with lu≈øts, that as there is no fruit of holines to God, or righteou≈ønes to men; but the minde of man is over run with di≈øtempers, and therefore (as they ≈øay) we mu≈øt give it another tilling, by plowing up the weeds, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. <hi>As you have given your
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111041:18"/>members weapons to unrighteou≈ønes; ≈øo now give your members as ≈øervants unto righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, unto holine≈ø≈øe:</hi> the meaning is, as we have given our members, in the ≈øame proportion as we have given them to ≈øin; ≈øo we ≈øhould give them to be at the command of the ≈øpirit, the ≈øame under≈øtanding, will, and affections; whereas, if God rai≈øe them out of ≈øtones, as he can doe, he mu≈øt fir≈øt give it to be a man, and make it to have a body and a ≈øoule, and then convert it; but he need not doe ≈øo, when he comes to men or children: As if a man would have a crop of Corn upon a rock, he mu≈øt fir≈øt make it ground, and then plow them; but if hee have ground, although it have thorns and rubbi≈øh, when he hath removed that, he may plow it, and expect a crop, becau≈øe ground is capable to bear Corn. Now the proof of the point is plain; that the nature of man is capable, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; that which is capable of a privation is capable of the habit of the contrary grace. of nece≈ø≈øity; the in beeing of a thing requires a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blens: the eye cannot be ≈øaid to be blind except it be capable of ≈øeeing; it is not ≈øaid, a mans hand is blinde, becau≈øe it is not capable of ≈øeeing; ≈øo the body may be ≈øaid to be dead, becau≈øe it is capable of life; ≈øo it is in the under≈øtanding, it is full of blindene≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe it is capable of ≈øeeing; and ≈øo the will is capable of holine≈ø≈øe, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Once you were darknes, now you are light in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. <hi>As we have born the Image of the earthly, ≈øo we mu≈øt beare the image of the heavenly;</hi> the body is ≈øick, and it may have help.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our nature is not nextly fit for grace, yet it is capable, that is, the roome may be made fit, though it be not fit for the pre≈øent: as a Ve≈ø≈øell that is full of ill liquor, it is capable to hold good liquor, but it is not fit before the filthy liquor be powred out: ≈øo our nature is capable of grace, we need not change our being, but wee mu≈øt bee made fit.</p>

               <hi>Particular.</hi> The ≈øpirit of God does in all men, whether young or old, fir≈øt loo≈øe the ≈øoule of a ≈øinner from ≈øin and ≈øelf, by his Almighty power; before he puts a principle of grace into the ≈øoule, and before he leads the ≈øoule to God in Chri≈øt, this mu≈øt be done; take a childe, or a man, God does work this, it is the nature of Gods di≈øpen≈øation, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkne≈ø≈øe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, &amp;c.</hi> Fir≈øt, they are taken from under him, and then they are turned to God, and <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>Becau≈øe I have cho≈øen you out of the world, therfore the world hates you, &amp;c.</hi> you were under the power of ≈øin, and I have called you out, &amp; then I will cal you to my ≈øelfe <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power

            <p>Thirdly, In this double work of the ≈øpirit, the ≈øpirit depo≈øes ≈øin and ≈øelf, and then powers in a principle of grace: in both the≈øe, all men that receive the worke of the ≈øpirit are meere patients: when it depo≈øes ≈øin and ≈øelf, young and old, and are meer patients, all men, children, and infants; thus it is in all on whom the great work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion is, they are meerly patients; we have already made it good: I will give you two or three rea≈øons of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Aver≈øion cannot bee a cau≈øe of ≈øalvation, a frame to turn from God cannot help a man to turn to God, no more then light can cau≈øe darkne≈ø≈øe, ≈øin and ≈øelf carry the ≈øoule from God; and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry the ≈øoule to God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the fle≈øh lu≈øteth again≈øt the ≈øpirit, and the ≈øpirit lu≈øteth again≈øt the fle≈øh;</hi> and tho≈øe are contrary one to another.

               <item>2. That which cannot be ≈øubject to the Law of God, cannot be a cau≈øe of the work of the ≈øpirit, but ≈øin and ≈øelf cannot be ≈øubject, and therefore they cannot be the cau≈øe of the working of the ≈øpirit; nay, the nature of man cannot be, nay they cannot ≈øuffer the work upon them, they are not able to bear it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>It is not ≈øubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That which is wholy beyond the power of corrupt nature, that corrupt nature cannot bee the cau≈øe of; but to put off ≈øin and ≈øelf, is wholy beyond the power of corrupt nature; for nothing can work beyond the power of its own principle; and of our ≈øelves, we are not able to think a good thought; So it mu≈øt be given us, ≈øo we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, that therefore, we are all meer patients in the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion, both men and children.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="4">4. Here lies the life of the an≈øwer in the≈øe ≈øeverall works, where the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111041:19"/>hearts are ≈øufferers, the ≈øoules of Infants are as much fit as the ≈øoules of any man, and not ≈øo much unfit as the ≈øoules of many men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace: and they have as great a capability as men have, and in ≈øome mea≈øure a greater capabilitic then ≈øome men have: here is two things to be con≈øidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are as fit as any, but not ≈øo unfit as many; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are meet ≈øufferers in the work of the ≈øpirit to have ≈øin and ≈øelf ≈øubdued; the ≈øoules of children are as fit, and have as great a capabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You mu≈øt remember, heretofore we have made it good, that all the ≈øonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are tainted with Originall ≈øin equally, no man have le≈ø≈øe of <hi>Adams</hi> ≈øin, nor le≈ø≈øe of Originall ≈øin one then another, but all men and children are equall here, and men of years have contracted many actuall ≈øins; nay, whatever they doe before they are converted, is ≈øin, all their thoughts, words, and deeds, ≈øo as they grow more proud and more witty to commit ≈øin, and to doe wickedly: becau≈øe of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion ≈øome grow more ≈øturdy in their ≈øinfull cour≈øes, which is drawn and contracted by actuall ≈øin, and infants are free from tho≈øe; now tho≈øe that have acted them, are more fit to commit them, nay many are habituated in commiting of ≈øin, ≈øo as they have gotten a habit of drunkennes, and a habit of uncleanes, &amp;c. ≈øo as it is plain, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are as fit as any, and not ≈øo unfit as many are; for if children have as little oppo≈øition as any, and le≈ø≈øe then ≈øome, then it mu≈øt needes be true.

we ≈øhall ≈øee the plain meaning.</item>

            <p n="1">1. Of whom the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes: If you look into the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

If a man take a di≈øta≈øt again≈øt his wife, he may not give her a bill of divorce, nor put her away for that, although formerly they might doe it, but it is unlawfull now. Chri≈øt had ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plainly to that, therefore I will not ≈øpeak to it. But <hi>to the re≈øt,</hi> that is, tho≈øe that were married Infidels, he takes that for granted, that they were not converted before they were married, but they were both Infidels, and the one is converted, and the other left; to the≈øe I ≈øpeak, in the 13, 14, 15. ver≈øes; concerning the≈øe, Chri≈øt hath not ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he hath not expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in this ca≈øe; but I ≈øpeake to that, I have the Spirit of God, the≈øe are the parties, both unbelievers, and one of them is converted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of what hee ≈øpeakes: the ≈øtate of the que≈øtion, the one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the other is not, the unbelieving party hinders the work of the believing party: the que≈øtion is, whether they ≈øhould continue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between them, there being ≈øo much oppo≈øition; whether they may doe it without prejudice to the con≈øcience of the believing party in that ordinance of God, or may they have the pure u≈øe of marriage? His an≈øwer is, It is a matter of duty, if ≈øhe will yet remain, it is a duty enjoyned of God. Mark the Apo≈øtles que≈øtion, not whether they may marry an unbeliever, that is not here ≈øpoken of; but it is taken for granted they were both unbelievers, and now one is converted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or ≈øhe may continue, the an≈øwer is, Yes, he may &amp; mu≈øt.

The Apo≈øtle proves it by the effect; where holine≈ø≈øe is in the effect, there it is in the cau≈øe, the wife hath the child that comes of her, fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally holy, therefore they have right to the priviledges of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant; if the one party be faithfull, their children are federally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ≈øo they may have a ≈øanctified u≈øe of Gods ordinance: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, if both be unbelievers, they have no right, but are as Pagans, and have no right to the priviledges of Gods covenant.</p>
            <p>Now we will come to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spilsbery's</hi> interpretation in foure things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The holine≈ø≈øe here is meant the holine≈ø≈øe of the fle≈øh, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanne≈ø≈øe is meant the uncleanne≈ø≈øe of the fle≈øh, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. they had married ≈øtrange wives, and by Gods appointment they were to put them away, they acknowledge, <hi>we have tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed,</hi> and therefore they make a covenant to put them away, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.18. <hi>He that commits fornication, ≈øinneth again≈øt his own body, &amp;c.</hi> And 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 4. 2, 3. <hi>For this is the will of God, even your ≈øanctification, that every one of you know how to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe his ve≈ø≈øell in ≈øanctification and honour.</hi> In the 22. <hi>pape</hi> and the 23. line.</item>
               <item>2 The holine≈ø≈øe of the Parents, and of the children, are of the ≈øame kinde, and mu≈øt be attended in the ≈øame way, and not in a divers manner, in 23. <hi>page,</hi> and 26. <hi>line.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 The holine≈ø≈øe of the fle≈øh is this, when they match according to Gods allowance; the uncleanne≈ø≈øe is, when they meet together in an unclean manner, and cro≈ø≈øe to God: and lawfulne≈ø≈øe in their marriage is holine≈ø≈øe, when parties come together in a lawfull manner, tho≈øe have holine≈ø≈øe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Again, when children are born in a lawfull way of marriage, they are clean when they are lawfully begotten: but if they be unlawfully begotten, then they are unclean, ≈øo Ba≈øtards are unclean: when they meet in a way of God, then they are holy, but if in adultery, then they are unholy. The meaning of the Text is (≈øaith he) el≈øe they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtards; but now they are right born.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>Ground</hi> is (≈øaith he) you judge your children holy, and therefore you may dwell one with another, your marriage is good: this is the la≈øt.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:111041:25"/>
            <p>The ground he makes to be this; the Chri≈øtians wrote to the Apo≈øtles becau≈øe of that in the 10. of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that was the occa≈øion of the ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and upon this ground they wrote it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1, among many other, this was one ocea≈øion, and this is the ≈øub≈øtance of his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; again≈øt this I will give you ≈øeverall rea≈øons, and ≈øo quit the place: I will doe it in three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The ≈øtate of the que≈øtion does no way ≈øuit the intendment of the Apo≈øtle in regard of the Parties, for they make the que≈øtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them≈øelves, and ≈øo the parties carry no rea≈øon with them in <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> for they in <hi>Ezra</hi> were matched to them of a contrary Religion, in the entrance of their marriage, Jews and Heathen, they ≈øuite not therefore with the Apo≈øtles aime; hee wrote to them in <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>rinth,</hi> and they were all Pagans as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Yee know that you were Gentiles carryed away unto the≈øe dumb Idols as you were led,</hi> ≈øo that all of them were Heathens, therefore the parties differ; and the ≈øtate of the que≈øtion is not whether they may marry one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that was out of que≈øtion; for marriage is honourable among all men, the bed undefiled, God did not forbid them marriage: but now, one of them being converted after they were married; now they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion whether if either be converted, whether they ≈øhould abide with a pure con≈øcience one with another, that is not converted; now here is a ≈øanctified per≈øon, and that party may have a ≈øanctified u≈øe of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to a holy end; and therefore may abide with a pure con≈øcience: this ca≈øt the cau≈øe fully.</item>
               <item>2. This cro≈ø≈øes the grain of the text, it will not admit of it. I ≈øhew it thus; that a civill way of marriage is not meant here, for that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe is meant here of which the believer is the cau≈øe to derive to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity, of them the words of the text is meant, and it will admit no other; mark, the unbelieving party is ≈øanctified to and in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving party, it comes by the believing part; for to the pure all things are pure, he or ≈øhe hath a ≈øanctified u≈øe in their con≈øcience, and the ordinance: the Apo≈øtle doth not ≈øay, the believer is ≈øanctified by the unbeliever; that is cro≈ø≈øe to the texts, but the unbeliever is ≈øanctified by the believer, and ≈øo it is communicated to po≈øterity: Now they are clean; how? by the believer; to the children they are made holy; but mark, if you take it of the fle≈øh, that is, of all ≈øuch as are lawfully married: marriage is as lawfull to Infidels as to believers, but that is not ≈øo meant. Again, the children of Infidels that are not ba≈øe born, come from both parents, and both communicate to the Childe; but mark the holine≈ø≈øe here meant, is, from the believer alone; but this lawfulne≈ø≈øe of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111041:26"/>marriage belongs to Infidels; and therefore that cannot be meant here; but this is to believers, but that of marriage is not ≈øo, and therefore it is federall holine≈ø≈øe which is proper to beleevers.</item>
               <item>3. This interpretation takes off the Argument, and makes this Rea≈øon no Rea≈øon; for it ≈øtands thus, If your children be not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtards, you may ≈øtay together. Mark, it takes of the edge of it; for the Apo≈øtles rea≈øon doth not take away the doubt of the que≈øtion: For if he ≈øay thus, if you marry lawfuly, your children are not Ba≈øtards, your doubt doth ≈øtill remaine; for that might be as doubtfull as the former: for this doth not prove their intere≈øt in their marriage, nor the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of it, and therefore it cannot prove it. If a que≈øtion be, whether ≈øuch a man be lawfully married or not, if I ≈øhould come &amp; tell him, if you be lawfully married, your children are no ba≈øtards: this doth not prove it: for it i≈ø≈øues from hence, if ye que≈øtion the one, the other may be more: that he alledges to ea≈øe this, he ≈øayes he ≈øpeakes to your apprehen≈øion, you judge your children are no Ba≈øtards this cro≈ø≈øes the words of the Text: for he doth not ≈øay, el≈øe you may judge them unholy; but he ≈øaith, they are holy, whether they thinke ≈øo or not, ≈øo as it perverts the Text. Again, it cro≈øles the rea≈øonable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of a man that knowes what he ≈øpeakes; if I know the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are no ba≈øtards, I ≈øhould not que≈øtion whether the man and wife be lawfully married, for it hath reference to one lawfully married: if he ≈øay, he is not lawfully married, then they are not lawfully born: it cro≈ø≈øes Rea≈øon to be unlawfully born, when lawfully married; ≈øo they take off the glo≈ø≈øe of the place.</item>

            <p n="1">1 What is meant here by holine≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>The An≈øwer is, Federall holine≈ø≈øe, not the holine≈ø≈øe of ≈øanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but confederation; that holine≈ø≈øe which is part of ≈øanctification, is that which is ≈øpoken of, <hi>Epehe≈ø.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and true holine≈ø≈øe:</hi> But ≈øo it is not here u≈øed, but for <hi>arelative holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> whereby they were knit' to God, and he to them; they avouch him to be their God, and he avouches them to be his people. One place he complaines, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2. <hi>They have mixed the holy ≈øeed with the people of the Lands, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:111041:26"/>The holy ≈øeed is the Jews, they mingled with the common people, that is, ≈øuch as were not free Burge≈ø≈øes in the Church, that is, they were mingled among the heathen; all the people of the land were not ≈øancti≈øted, but they were holy in this way: that it is federall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, appeares; ≈øanctification is never conveyed by the Father to the Child, this is from the Spirit of God, , he workes as he ≈øees fit, therefore two in one bed, one taken and another left; ≈øo two in one belly, one taken, and another left: but this is by ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, <hi>If the root be holy, ≈øo are the branches; if the fir≈øt fruits be holy, ≈øo is the whole lump:</hi> the root and fir≈øt fruits; and from him is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, <hi>Abraham</hi> did covenant for his, as well as for him≈øelf, wee may ≈øcoin the 17 ver≈øe, ≈øanctification cannot be lo≈øt, but the branches are broken off that came of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and proved a vagabond people, they may be cut off, but ≈øanctification cannot be lo≈øt; they lo≈øt their confederate holines, but they that are ≈øanctified ≈øhall be glorified.</p>
            <p>Hence we may ≈øee the growing of the≈øe branches is not the growing of ≈øaving faith, but federall holines; it is not the growing to Chri≈øt by faith, for then they ≈øhould never be broken off from faith: to ≈øay ≈øo, is a fal≈øhood; for if a man be called he ≈øhall be glorified, we are made one ≈øpirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. <hi>This is a great my≈øtery, but I ≈øpeak concerning Chri≈øt and his Church,</hi> if Chri≈øt ≈øhould lo≈øe one, he ≈øhould be unperfect. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. <hi>The fulne≈ø≈øe of him that filleth all in all things.</hi> Chri≈øt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, but if he want one member, he ≈øhould not be compleat. This is cleare, ≈øaving grace cannot be lo≈øt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That holines agrees with the body of the Gentiles, they are brought into a vi≈øible covenant, as in the 17 ver≈øe, they are brought into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that is the root and the fatnes is the priviledges: the body of the Gentiles had not ≈øanctification.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by <hi>fir≈øt Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Lump,</hi> one is from the Ceremoniall Law among the Jewes, <hi>Lovit.</hi> 23.14.17. <hi>You ≈øhall eat neither bread nor parched Corn, nor green eares, untill the ≈øelfe ≈øame day you have brought an offering to the Lord your God.

No, for the Jewes were corrupt as well as they: the Jewes were as deep in originall ≈øinne as they; not onely contrary to corrupt nature, but they were wild by nature, that is, they were under ≈øuch a di≈øpen≈øation, that God was not ingaged to them, and ≈øo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them were under the like condition, they were in ≈øuch a cour≈øe, as they had not the meanes to mend them, nay they had no ingagement of God, but they were under the cur≈øe of God, without meanes; but now the true Olive, that grew not wild; not that they had not as many ≈øinnes by nature; and as they, ≈øo their children, the ≈øame ≈øinne in their nature: but they had an intere≈øt in the meanes to help them, and God had ingaged him≈øelfe to them in Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, <hi>I will cau≈øe them to walk in my wayes,</hi> that is, the Church ≈øhould not grow wild, becau≈øe they had meanes, and God had inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him≈øelfe to them.

            <p>Now to the true Olive in way of oppo≈øition they were the Jewes; not by way of ≈øinne, but becau≈øe they were under the hand of God, and ≈øo they had an intere≈øt in the meanes of grace. Now the Jewes, though they were wicked, yet they were not wild, but they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods hand ordering them: and hence they were pre≈øerved under his hand. This is the meaning of the Prophets, you may referre them to this, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>The Lord had a Vineyard, and he planted it, and fenced it, and made a wine-pre≈ø≈øe in it.</hi> And in the ≈øeventh ver≈øe, <hi>And what could I have done more for my Vineyard?</hi> Here you may ≈øee what care and skill God did u≈øe towards them.</p>

The fir≈øt part is granted, the ≈øecond part is fal≈øe. To force a naturall ≈øpou≈øe upon Chri≈øt, is unlawfull, that is granted: But the ≈øecond part is fal≈øe, and the Argument is wor≈øe, that the baptizing of Infants make a godle≈ø≈øe Church. For fir≈øt, that children are gracele≈ø≈øe, none can prove: if they be gracele≈ø≈øe, if they die in their infancy, they mu≈øt peri≈øh, for they are out of Chri≈øt; but they dare not affirm that them≈øelves, &amp; it hath been proved, that God hath provided a portion of glory for infants, and it is certain, that all that are elect infants, that die in their infancy, God doth work faith in their hearts, and therefore it is gro≈øly fal≈øe, and the weakne≈ø≈øe of it appeares thus, Our children in the time of the Go≈øpel, are the ≈øame with them among the Jewes, and God did joyn them to Chri≈øt as he does now, there is the ≈øame rea≈øon now as then.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The baptizing of Infants doth not make them members of the Church, for they are members before they be baptized, and bapti≈øme doth but ≈øeale up the covenant unto them; for bapti≈øme ≈øuppo≈øes they if in the body fir≈øt; and the proof of it is more gro≈ø≈øe then the other: he he will di≈øpute it, he mu≈øt prove it, becau≈øe ≈øuch a Church is founded upon naturall birth, all children of believers are by nature the children

Now gather it up, children are federally holy, becau≈øe they come of holy parents; they are holy becau≈øe of the covenant which they receive, God brought them in becau≈øe he loved them, and he loved them becau≈øe he loved them; and becau≈øe he loved them, he cho≈øe them; and becau≈øe he cho≈øe them, he brought them into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and therefore meerly of grace: So that men are or will be blind, if they doe not ≈øee this.</p>

He ≈øayes ≈øo, we may ≈øay it is not ≈øo; and our ≈øaying is as good as his. But I ≈øay, the fir≈øt part is true: but that baptizing of infants makes a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church, that I deny; for it will not follow: but the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a nationall Church did belong onely to the Jewes, and there fore it had nationall ordinances, they were to meet three times a yeare before the Lord; and they had nationall Officers, the High Prie≈øt, and all the males were bound to appeare three times a yeare, ≈øo all was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall: but now it is not ≈øo, but they are particular to particular churches, and particular ordinances, and particular officers, the Pa≈øtor and Teacher is or ought to be in their own congregation; and though children are baptized, they are made members of a particular congregation. And be≈øides, a Nationall church in it ≈øelfe does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy the body of Chri≈øt: For that which God hath appointed for his church, that doth not de≈øtroy the church; for then God may be ≈øaid to de≈øtroy the church: but that were bla≈øphemy to ≈øay ≈øo. But now all are in a particular church. And the ≈øecond part is as fal≈øe, that it brings in gracele≈ø≈øe members into the church; for the baptizing of infants is no cau≈øe of it, for that does not make them, but ≈øeales up the meanes of grace to them, as God ≈øayes, they are <hi>under his wing. What could I have done more for them? Deut.</hi> 6.18. God brings them into manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he hath them in his hands as plants of his embracing in the means of grace: if they bring infants into the congregation, they bring them under the meanes, and God ingages him≈øelfe unto them.

            <p>This is the ≈øub≈øtance of the Argument, That practice that upholds the ≈øtate of Antichri≈øt, is ≈øinfull: But the bapti≈øing of infants upholds the ≈øtate of Antichri≈øt, and makes the church of <hi>Rome</hi> a true church; therefore the baptizing of infants is ≈øinfull.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer in the generall, this reaches not the cau≈øe in hand: For our que≈øtion is not, whether bapti≈øme in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> be true or not, but whether it belawfull in a church that is gathered and well ordered according to Chri≈øt, and therefore that he ≈øpeakes here, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not the cau≈øe.

Children when they doe ≈øurvive may receive the benefit of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme by faith, built upon the word of God, and not upon humane rea≈øon; they may receive the benefit of their faith built upon the word, thus in≈øtanced; who≈øoever doe or have received bapti≈øme by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God to them, God on his part hath ≈øealed up the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them; but children have ≈øo received, and therefore they have the covenant ≈øealed on Gods part to them; and therefore they may have the comfort of it, that they have received it on Gods part: every man that by Gods order hath the ≈øeale, God ≈øeales to him; then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the order of the Go≈øpel, have received the ≈øeale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ≈øo both are true: but how doth it appear that a childe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, that is not to be required in the ≈øcriptures, but in practice; not in the Go≈øpel nor is required in the cau≈øe: for it is enough that the propo≈øition or conclu≈øion be in the ≈øcriptures, that this is true, I will give you ≈øeverall in≈øtances. Thus it is a truth, That all children mu≈øt honour their father and mother; and therefore every childe mu≈øt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Parents: but how ≈øhall the childe know that this man is his Father, or this woman his Mother; the common te≈øtimony is enough to the childe, for to give them obedience of faith, although it be not ≈øet down in the ≈øcriptures; that this or that man or woman is his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: and ≈øo in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> The Unkle mu≈øt not marry his Neece, for that was a ≈øin; for all ≈øuch marriages is unlawfull: but how ≈øhall this woman know this was her Unkle? The con≈øtant report of men is enough in this cau≈øe: <hi>And remember you keep holy the Sabbath day,</hi> this was the ≈øeventh day from the Creation to the Jews, and the eighth day to us; but how ≈øhould they know which was the ≈øeventh day, <hi>Abraham</hi> living ≈øo long after the beginning of the world, and it was not written in the word which was the ≈øeventh day: ≈øo that it mu≈øt be by witne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo this is enough; for the conclu≈øion is of faith. So for the benefit of baptizing of Infants, the te≈øtimony of them that lived when I was baptized, is enough to ≈øettle me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men of years have not a better bottome to beare up their faith
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111041:37"/>then children have, they may have a ≈øtronger, but it is the ≈øame for the kinde; whoever have received the ≈øacrament according to Chri≈øt hath a ≈øcale of the covenant; but I have ≈øo received it, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me, may a man of years ≈øay now in the time of the Go≈øpel; now you may ≈øay, let him prove it? he may ≈øay, I have heard the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter pray over me, and ≈øaw him take the water and ≈øprinkle mee: he ≈øayes ≈øo; but it is but humane te≈øtimony: ≈øo for a childe, others heard ≈øo, all is but humane te≈øtimony; ≈øo for your own experience, it is more, but the ≈øame in kinde: humane te≈øtimony is the ≈øame ground, ≈øo both of them are the ≈øame for kinde.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The rea≈øon ≈øhews two things contrary to truth:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That knowledge of Bapti≈øme is a fundamentall of Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the te≈øtimony of others ≈øtands in the place of the word of God, that I have heard or preacht in new <hi>England</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the word of God, all the particular actions that a man does, he needs not bring in proofe out of the word of God, and therefore it does not ≈øtand in the place of the word of God, and ≈øo we ≈øee it is fal≈øe; I could have ≈øpoken more ≈øhort of the≈øe things, but that they are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuall to the people.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Argument,</hi> The bapti≈øing of Infants makes the Ordinance of Chri≈øt a lying ≈øigne; for it is not to be expected in an Infant, that which this Ordinance doth call for: the argument ≈øtands thus, That practice that makes the ordinance of Chri≈øt a lying ≈øigne, is unlawfull; but the bapti≈øing of Infants makes the ordinance of Chri≈øt a lying ≈øigne, and therefore it is unlawfull. The fir≈øt part of the argument we grant, but the ≈øecond part here is the old frame, a bare affirmation, but no proof that it is not to be expected, but it ≈øhould be proved, but here is deep ≈øilence: It ≈øhould have bin proved that God works faith in Infants are elected, that dye before they be bapti≈øed; and if Mr. <hi>Spilsbery</hi> will but hold to his principles, he ≈øhall be the man that ≈øhall ≈øay ≈øo, <hi>All children ≈øtand defiled of originall ≈øin, and if they be polluted, either that mu≈øt be removed or they cannot come into heaven;</hi> if they come to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the power and pre≈øence of ≈øin mu≈øt be taken away, or el≈øe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe nor enjoy God; and therefore either they mu≈øt let it go, or el≈øe it mu≈øt be removed; but they cannot let it goe, and therefore it mu≈øt be removed, and where the privation is, there will be the habit; and therefore if ≈øin be gone, there is perfect ≈øanctification: and he mu≈øt conclude ≈øinning to be gone, in all that be ≈øaved, he dare not deny it. And if they be guilty, they ≈øtand in need of a Redeemer; and if they be redeemed they mu≈øt be redeemed by Chri≈øt, or ≈øome other way;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111041:38"/>but there is no other way, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is no other name whereby we may be ≈øaved;</hi> and therefore if they be redeemed, they mu≈øt ≈øhare with Chri≈øt in his ≈øatisfaction, and therefore they mu≈øt have union with him; and if they have union, they mu≈øt have faith, and ≈øo he may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confe≈ø≈øe and yeeld they have ≈øo.</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>The ≈øubject of Bapti≈øme mu≈øt be pa≈ø≈øive, but infants are not pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, as the ordinance requires, and ≈øo not fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The frame of the Argument is, If infants be not ≈øit ≈øubjects for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme, they are not to be baptized: But they are not fit ≈øubjects for bapti≈øme, and therefore they ≈øhould not be baptized; they mu≈øt be fit to receive it, or el≈øe it oppo≈øes bapti≈øme. 2. It mu≈øt be ≈øo pa≈ø≈øive, that it mu≈øt produce a voluntary ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the ordinance, he proves it hath ≈øuch a ≈øuperior work they may ≈øubmit to the ordinance by force, and yet not be fit ≈øubjects; but they mu≈øt be freely pa≈ø≈øive that be fit ≈øubjects. Here is the old gui≈øe, an Argument taken and framed, but nothing proved; for the Argument is more fal≈øe then the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They ≈øay they oppo≈øe bapti≈øme. If they mean an outward oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, they may ea≈øily be confuted; for infants doe not ≈øo oppo≈øe it. If they mean an inward oppo≈øition, when the Spirit workes, it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way re≈øi≈øtance; and children doe as little oppo≈øe, and le≈ø≈øe, then men; and when the Spirit comes, he findes le≈ø≈øe oppo≈øition in them, then in men; and they are as capable by nature as men, and they are meetly pa≈ø≈øive in that, as well as children: for the Spirit works in us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; he takes away ≈øin, and puts in a principle of life: ≈øo he can ≈øeal us without us. If they ≈øay there mu≈øt be ≈øuch a taking away of oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as frees them from ≈øinne, and hath ≈øaving grace: That is fal≈øe; for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, and yet he had it not: and therefore take it in what regard you will, there is no more rea≈øon why children ≈øhould not, then why men ≈øhould not.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It mu≈øt be a free and voluntary ≈øubjection: if they mu≈øt expre≈ø≈øe it outwardly, it is not required in all tho≈øe that receive the ≈øeale, no more then circumci≈øion was here; if they mean freely and willingly to take the ≈øeale, that is not enough: for there are many will ≈øubmit, that are not fit for the ordinance, as they doe to the Supper of the Lord. If they ≈øay they mu≈øt have the power of ≈øaving grace, that is fal≈øe; for <hi>Johns</hi> hearers had it not: but if they mean federall holine≈ø≈øe, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is holy thus.</p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>It oppo≈øes the words of the Text, by ≈øaying children are conceived in grace,</hi> P≈øalm 51.5. <hi>What a thing is it to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The frame of the Argument is, That practi≈øe that oppo≈øes the word of God, is ≈øinfull: But the baptizing of infants doth oppo≈øe the word of God, and therefore it is ≈øinfull. That he ≈øayes, proves nothing; hee had as good ≈øay, what unholy men ≈øay, that infants are clean from the womb, we have often met with ≈øuch things, and it were enough to gain≈øay it onely, for it is fal≈øe.</p>
            <p>That I ≈øay to his proofe is:
<list>
                  <item>1. No man ≈øayes infants are holy; but there is no more holine≈ø≈øe required in us, then in the time of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion; that does not oppo≈øe the word: <hi>For Adam beg at a ≈øonne in his owne likene≈ø≈øe.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>The frame of mans heart is evill, and onely evill continually. P≈øalm</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was born in iniquity, and in ≈øin hath my mother conceived me:</hi> Then by the word of God infants had holine≈ø≈øe required, and therefore it was not cro≈ø≈øe to the word; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other holine≈ø≈øe then they did.</item>
                  <item>2 If he or any Anabapti≈øt can bring any writings that doe maintaine they are not born in ≈øinne, by any that oppo≈øe their delu≈øions, then they ≈øay ≈øomewhat; but they have not, nor cannot: nay, the mo≈øt of them, their old generation, deny originall ≈øinne to be in infants, though the younger blu≈øh at it to own it; but the old deny it, and ≈øay, they ≈øinne by imitation, and that their ≈øin is theirs, and their fall is theirs, it may ≈øilence impudence it ≈øelfe.</item>
                  <item>3 All the holine≈ø≈øe we attribute to them, is not by nature, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe all born of ≈øinfull parents, and are polluted with originall ≈øinne by nature: all the holine≈ø≈øe we a≈øcribe unto them, is not by nature, not by propagation, but that which is their parents, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>But thou art a holy people unto thy God, the Lord thy God hath cho≈øen thee to be a pretious people unto, him≈øelfe, above all people that are upon the earth.</hi> And hence they are called <hi>the naturall branches, Rom.</hi> 11.24. <hi>For if thou wa≈øt out of the Olive tree, which was wild by nature, and wa≈øt grafted contrary to Nature into the right Olive tree, how much more ≈øhall they that are by nature be grafted in their own Olive tree?</hi> So as we look at no other holine≈ø≈øe but what the Word ≈øayes, and hath ≈øaid from the beginning in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> time; ≈øo as what he ≈øayes is fal≈øe in this kind again≈øt us.</item>

For if they be ≈øubjects of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111041:39"/>grace, they are ≈øubjects of glory; and if ≈øubjects of glory, they mu≈øt be ≈øubjects of grace: <hi>For no unclean thing ≈øhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi> He dare not deny that, for if he doe, be mu≈øt deny that which the word doth affirm.</item>

            <p>And now we have done with all his Arguments; and wee ≈øee the Batteries rai≈øed again≈øt this Doctrine, and by what hath been ≈øaid, I doubt not but under≈øtanding men in the congregation, may be able to give an an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the rea≈øons of the point, which are foure,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That practice that is commanded in the Word, is lawfull: But ≈øo is baptizing of the Infants of tho≈øe that are in covenant; and therefore it is lawfull. It is contained in the Word either inplain words, or may be nece≈ø≈øarily inferred from the words: I here expre≈ø≈øe it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily inferred, to let you ≈øee that it is ≈øuch a dreame to ≈øay there is nothing Scripture but that which is expre≈ø≈øed in ≈øo many words: For it may be nece≈ø≈øarily included, although not plainly expre≈ø≈øed. And that this is ≈øo, we may ≈øee it in the New Te≈øtament and in the Old: That it is included, ≈øee <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth; Goe therefore and teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt.

Now they had Authority to plant churches, and to baptize them: I rea≈øon thus, if Children be included in tho≈øe that are to be made Di≈øciples, then they are to be made partakers of the Seales of the Covenant: But Children are made partakers of the Covenant of the parents; and therefore it warrants the Seale to bee given to the Child; if the warrant be alike to the one as to the other, then the child may be partaker of it as well as the parents; if the parents be in covenant, the children be in covenant, and made Di≈øciples: All the difficulty lies in the ≈øecond part, That children are in covenant, if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be in the covenant and included; we will open the place in three things,</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111041:42"/>thus ≈øaith the Lord to the Eunuches that keep my Sabbaths, and chu≈øe the thing that plea≈øeth me, and take hold of my covenant.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them from this tho≈øe that cho≈øe his covenant, tho≈øe that are made partakers of the priviledges of the church, that is, by joyning them ≈øelves to the church of the Jewes, they ≈øhall partake of the Ordinances of Chri≈øt that the Jewes partake of, and that is the ≈øame that is acted now. This is the ≈øtrength of the Apo≈øtles di≈øpute: If the promi≈øe be made to you and your children: then you may partake of the ≈øeale, you and your children.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtles Argument runs thus, Becau≈øe <hi>Abraham</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were circumci≈øed, as a ≈øeale of the covenant; ≈øo all tho≈øe that take hold of the covenant, have right to the Seale for them and their children: it carries weight for weight. The Anabapti≈øts are troubled with this, and quarrell much at it, and ≈øay, By children here is not meant infants, but children by imitation, meaning ≈øuch as follow the ≈øteps of their godly parents: As <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>They an≈øwered and ≈øaid unto him, Abraham is our Father. Je≈øus ≈øaid unto them, If you were Abrahams children, you would doe the works of Abraham.</hi> So as there it is taken in a ≈øpirituall ≈øen≈øe. But this makes nothing to their purpo≈øe. For this promi≈øe makes nothing to that, <hi>The promi≈øe is made to you and to your children;</hi> that promi≈øe is not the covenant, but it is another promi≈øe, the rai≈øing of Chri≈øt to be a Redeemer, it is Chri≈øt to the Jewes is meant here: ≈øo that promi≈øe will not abide it. This is that they alledge. It is true, children ≈øometimes are taken for imitation; but if it had been ≈øo in this place, he ≈øhould have proved it: But here is a deep ≈øilence, and no proofe. We further reply, the promi≈øe cannot be here meant, nor can it be the ≈øen≈øe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That promi≈øe that is here meant, is that promi≈øe that gives evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and intere≈øt to the ≈øeale of the covenant: For they that have the one, have right to the other. If the promi≈øe be to you and to your ≈øeed, therefore be baptized: ≈øo as it is not from repentance, not bee baptized, becau≈øe you repent, that cro≈ø≈øes the di≈øpute: For <hi>Job</hi> did repent, and yet he had not an intere≈øt in circumci≈øion: but he mu≈øt be Jew, if he will partake of the Ordinances of the Jewes. So in the Church of Chri≈øt, repentance is not the ground of the Apo≈øtles di≈øpate: but repentance is the conclu≈øion. The covenant is to your u≈øe; this is Gods way for you to partake of the Seale: it is the way both for you and yours, for the covenant was before the ≈øeale. The promi≈øe is there made, and that gives an intere≈øt into the ≈øeale of the covenant; it is not the preaching of the Go≈øpel that gives right to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111041:42"/>the ≈øeales of the covenant, but tho≈øe that are in the covenant, have right to the ≈øeales thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is confe≈ø≈øed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spilsbery,</hi> that all whom God ≈øhall call, that have an≈øwered the call of the Go≈øpel, and make profe≈ø≈øion of their faith, they have a title to the ≈øeales. Tho≈øe that are here under≈øtood, they pertain to ≈øuch as are vi≈øibly called: But the promi≈øe of the word is made to them that doe not an≈øwer the word: it belongs to them that are called. The promi≈øe that Chri≈øt is come in the fle≈øh, is made known to many that never were called; but tho≈øe that are in the covenant of the Church, the promi≈øe is made for the good of them and their feed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If by children we ≈øhould take men of yeares that follow the faith of their parents, we ≈øhould cro≈ø≈øe the letter of the Text, and the Apo≈øtle who makes three degrees; <hi>To you, your children, and tho≈øe that are far off:</hi> If the Text run thus, The promi≈øe is made to you and to all that God ≈øhall call, &amp; that an≈øwer the call; it cro≈ø≈øes the ≈øcope of the Text, for it is <hi>you and your children, and as many as are afarre off,</hi> all three, and therefore that interpretation cannot ≈øtand. If a man have but an humble heart, the words are ≈øo plain, it will carry away the heart, it goes from parents to children, to tho≈øe that ≈øhall be called hereafter, when they come in as you and your children are, then they and their children ≈øhall have it as you and your children have it, and not before. Now we will cleare this from all gain-≈øayers.</p>
            <p>They ≈øay, Infants of believing Parents may not receive it, becau≈øe they have not ability to receive that ≈øpirituall good of the Seale; or if they be able, God would not have them receive it: But neither of them are true, or can begranted, therefore they have a right to it.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Of <hi>In≈øtruction.</hi> Here we may ≈øee, and for ever magnifie the bounty &amp; compa≈ø≈øion of the fatherly love of God, in ≈øtooping to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities of his people; ≈øo that no weaknes of faith, or want of years, can hinder the compa≈ø≈øion of God towards them, but he takes mea≈øure of all our wants: Art thou weak in faith? It may be ≈øome heavine≈ø≈øe to thy ≈øelfe, becau≈øe thou can≈øt not conceive of thy e≈øtate, ≈øo as others can; but although thou bee≈øt weake, yet this hinders not the love of God to thee: For he loveth the little ones, and therefore the little ones may be comforted; for God denies no good to children, but even tho≈øe little ones are deare to him. God and Chri≈øt are carefull over them, as a good Shepheard who will be carefull over the young and tender of the flock, to feed them by the budding gra≈ø≈øe; the weak ones they ≈øhall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111041:43"/>feed by the tender budding gra≈ø≈øe, &amp; by the running waters. This is the great indulgence of God to his, and his marvellous care over his; and therefore let not the weak in faith, or a child ≈øay. God is not carefull of me: for God will gather his out-ca≈øts, he hath mercy &amp; compa≈ø≈øion for you. God is in the Reer-ward, nay he is in the Front and Reere too, he hath an eye to the ≈øick, weak, poor &amp; dead creatures; for he doth not only go before his, to incourage them, and inable them; but he is with them in the Reere, and he will gather them up al≈øo; he will hearken to them, &amp; wil gather them as the good Shepheard will take the little ones in his armes, and carry them tenderly; you that are little in your owne eyes, you that are in covenant with Chri≈øt, he will lead you and your little ones tenderly, and ≈øo he will all that are little in their owne eyes, and the eyes of the world.</p>
